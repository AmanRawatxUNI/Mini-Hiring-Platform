const itemsPerPage = 10
const totalPages = Math.ceil(filteredJobs.length / itemsPerPage)
const paginatedJobs = filteredJobs.slice(
  (currentPage - 1) * itemsPerPage,
  currentPage * itemsPerPage
)
```

```javascript
validators.required('Title is required')
validators.unique(existingSlugs, editingJob?.slug)
```

request(() => api.reorderJobs(reorderedJobs), {
  optimisticUpdate: () => setJobs(reorderedJobs),
  rollback: () => setJobs(previousJobs)
